          Hey there, thanks for visiting this website! My name is
          <strong>Amit Prafulla</strong> and I am a passionate software
          developer and an enthusiastic individual who thrives on new
          experiences. I belong to this city called
          <strong>Allahabad/Prayagraj</strong> in India. I have a Bachelor's
          degree in <strong>Computer Science</strong> as well as a Master's
          degree in <strong>Information Technology</strong> with specialization
          in Cyber Security.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have been working in the software industry for over 6 years now and
          have experience in various technologies such as
          <strong
            >Python, Django, FastAPI, React, Angular, Vue, Node.js, Express.js,
            MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, Google
            Cloud, and more</strong
          >. I have worked on various projects ranging from web development to
          cloud computing and have a keen interest in learning new technologies
          and frameworks. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and
          grow as a software developer. In my spare time I like to work on
          personal projects, do video editing, travel and play video games.

        <h3 class="is-2">"Travel is the air I breathe"</h3>
        <p>
          I simply love to travel and explore new places. I have been to various
          places in India and have also traveled to Europe. I'd often take a
          break from my work and go on a trip to some new place. I believe that
          traveling is the best way to learn about different cultures, meet new
          people, and experience new things. I have a bucket list of places that
          I want to visit and I am slowly ticking them off one at a time. I aim
          to visit all the
          <strong> UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India </strong> and explore
          the beauty of nature and ancient architecture. I've been to 24/42 such
          destinations as of now.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'd often go on solo trips and explore new places on my own. I believe
          that solo travel is the best way to learn about oneself and grow as an
          individual. At the time of writing this, I've already been to 20+ solo
          trips in my life covering 60+ cities in India.

          <h3 class="is-2">"I have multiple lives – in every game I play."</h3>
          <p>
            I love playing video games and it is one of my favorite pastimes. I
            have been playing video games since I was a kid and have played
            various games on different platforms. I enjoy playing games on
            <strong>PC, PS4/PS5, and Mobile</strong>. I have played games
            from various genres such as
            <strong>Role-Playing, Action, Adventure, Strategy, and Sports</strong
            >. I have played games like
            <strong
              >Pokemon, Call of Duty, FIFA, Need for Speed, GTA, Age of Empires, DOTA, 
              Counter Strike, Spider Man, Last of Us, Horizon Zero Dawn and many more</strong
            >.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            I believe gaming provides an escape from reality and lets you live multiple virtual lives. It is a great way to relax and unwind after a long day of work. 
            I often play games with my friends and family and enjoy the competitive spirit that comes with it. I also enjoy watching gaming streams on platforms like Twitch and YouTube. 
            I have a special liking for games with a good storyline and character development. I believe that games are a form of art and can evoke emotions and feelings just like any other form of art.
            Playing a game with a good story can be a truly immersive experience, it's like being part of a movie where you control the actions of the protagonist. Games like
            <strong>The Last of Us, God of War, Uncharted, Red Dead Redemption 2, Spider-Man, Batman and more</strong> have left a lasting impact on me.

        <h3 class="is-2">"Music is the essence of my spirit"</h3>
        <p>
          I love listening to music and it is an integral part of my life. I
          would often listen to instrumental music while I'm working or
          traveling. I believe that music has the power to heal and soothe the
          soul. I have a diverse taste in music and enjoy listening to various
          genres such as
          <strong>Classical, Jazz, Rock, and Pop</strong>. I also enjoy playing
          the Guitar and Piano. I've been learning to play those instruments for
          a few months now with little success. I am into
          <strong>Bollywood music</strong> especially the ones from 2003-2013.
          I've grown up listening to those songs on 9XM. They are still part of
          my playlist and I often listen to them while working or traveling.
          I've a special liking for slow romantic songs. I'd often try to sing
          those and create covers of them. My favorite singers are
          <strong
            >Arijit Singh, Mohit Chauhan, Sonu Nigam, and Shreya Ghoshal</strong
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also enjoy Western Music and have a special liking for bands like
          <strong
            >Backstreet Boys, One Direction, Linkin Park, The Chainsmokers 3
            Days Grace and Breaking Benjamin</strong
          >. My favorite singers are
          <strong
            >Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, Ellie Goulding, Katy Perry, Enrique
            Iglesias, Shakira and more</strong

          <h3 class="is-2">"My penchant for Photography and Video editing"</h3>
          <p>
            I think most people who travel have a natural inclination towards photography. I am no different. I love capturing moments and creating memories through photographs.
            I have a keen interest in photography and enjoy clicking pictures of landscapes, architecture, and people. I believe that photography is a form of art that allows you to express yourself and capture the beauty of the world around you. 
            I have a collection of photographs from my travels that I cherish and look back on fondly. I also enjoy editing photos and creating collages and albums to preserve my memories.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            I am also into video editing and have created various videos for my personal projects and travel diaries. I enjoy the process of editing videos and adding effects and music to create a visually appealing story. 
            I believe that video editing is a creative process that allows you to tell a story and evoke emotions through visuals and sound. 
            I have created videos for my travel diaries, personal projects, and events. I enjoy experimenting with different editing styles and techniques to create unique and engaging videos.
            I've worked with Softwares such as <strong>Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, Wondershare Filmora and Movavi Creative Suite</strong> for video editing.

          <h3 class="is-2">"I ❤️ Cooking"</h3>
          <p>
            Cooking is one of my favorite hobbies and I enjoy experimenting with different cuisines and recipes. I believe that cooking is a form of art that allows you to express yourself and create something delicious from scratch.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            I like to cook mostly Indian dishes. But, I do occasionally try my hand at other cuisines like Chinese and Italian. I enjoy cooking for my friends and family and love to see the smiles on their faces when they taste my food.
            I remember it was during the lockdown that I started cooking and experimenting with new recipes because we were forced to. I started with cooking Pizza and vegetable Pulao and since then haven't looked back. I'd often refer Youtube 
            cooking channels especializing in Indian cuisine for new recipes and try them out. I believe that cooking is a great way to relax and unwind after a long day and it is a skill that everyone should learn.
            I'd often close or open my day with a cooking session.

        <h3 class="is-2">"Games and Sports I am into"</h3>
        <p>
          I'm pretty much average in sports but I do enjoy playing them. I have played Cricket, Badminton, Table Tennis, and Football. I enjoy watching Tennis and Football matches on TV 
          and had been following the matches previously in the era of big 3. I have a special liking for <strong>Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, </strong> in Tennis. I don't think we'd ever see 3 players of their caliber in the same era again.
          I also used to regularly follow football when Real Madrid was at its peak with <strong>Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka, Modric, Kroos, Benzema, Bale, Ramos, Marcelo, Casillas, and more</strong>. I've stopped following
          sports lately but do enjoy watching Crickt matches occasionally with my friends and family.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have also played games like <strong>Chess, Carrom, Ludo, Snakes and Ladders, Monopoly, and Uno</strong>. I enjoy playing board games with my friends and family and it is a great way to spend quality time together.
          I have a competitive spirit and enjoy the thrill of winning a game. I believe that games teach you important life skills such as strategy, teamwork, and sportsmanship.

        <h3 class="is-2">"My screen time is reserved for real life."</h3>
        <p>
          Everyone around me seems to love watching movies and TV shows. I am not a big fan of them. I'd often watch movies with my friends and family but I don't have a habit of watching them alone. I'd often watch movies in theaters with my friends and family
          and there would often be a big gap between the movies I watch. I am a big fan of <strong>Marvel and DC movies</strong> and have watched most of them. 
          My favorite movies are <strong>Avengers Endgame, LOTR, The Dark Knight, Harry Potter Series, Inception, Good Will Hunting, The Shawshank Redemption, original Spider-Man </strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          In bollywood I'd often watch movies which have a good storyline and acting. I'd really think a lot before watching a movie because I believe that time is precious and 
          I don't want to waste it on something that doesn't add value to my life.
